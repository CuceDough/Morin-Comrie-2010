Morin-Comrie-2010
=================

This reqpository is for the Pulliam Lab exercise of reproducing the Culex quinquefasciatus population dynamic model by Morin and Comrie.

Each group should fork this repository to create their own working environment for the exercise. The exercise will be evaluated based on the output obtained from running the existing R script run.DyMSiM.R. Note that any changes you make to this file in your repository will not be retained for evaluation, so you will need to structure your code so it can be run using the unmodified file. Further information is given in the file itself.

The model we are aiming to reproduce was published in:

Morin, C. W., & Comrie, A. C. (2010). Modeled response of the West Nile virus vector Culex quinquefasciatus to changing climate using the dynamic mosquito simulation model. International Journal of Biometeorology, 54, 517–529. doi:10.1007/s00484-010-0349-6

The paper and the following references cited in the paper are available in the Lab's Journal Watch group on Mendeley.

NB: I could not find a copy of Hamon 1961; instead I have added the following reference to Mendeley, which might be useful in understanding equation 1:
